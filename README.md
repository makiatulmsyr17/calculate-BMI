# calculate-BMI
This project develops a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator application to assess the health of our classmates based on height and weight. The project will take the user's height and weight as input and then calculate their BMI. The result will fall into one of the BMI categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
