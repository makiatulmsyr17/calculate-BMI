# Calculate-BMI
In this project, we will analyze by calculating BMI using student data from the startup campus. The data has 24 participants, having information such as participant number, name, department, weight (in kilograms), and height (in centimeters). The main business question at hand is to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each participant based on their weight and height data, then categorize them into specific BMI ranges to assess their physical health status. 
Normal: 18.5-24.9
Overweight: 25.0-29.9
Obesity: 30.0-34.9
Underweight: < 18.5
